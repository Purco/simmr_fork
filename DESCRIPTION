Description: Fits Stable Isotope Mixing Models (SIMMs) and is meant as a 
longer term replacement to the previous widely-used package SIAR. SIMMs 
are used to infer proportional contribtuions of mixtures made up 
various sources from observations on mixtures themselves. A common 
application is when the mixtures are organisms' stable isotope values 
taken from their tissue and the sources are the stable isotope values 
taken from the organisms' food. SIMMs can also be used in other 
scenarios, such as in sediment mixing or the composition of fatty 
acids. The main functions are simmr_load and simmr_mcmc. 
The two vignettes contain a quick start and a full listing of 
all the features. The methods used are detailed in the papers 
Parnell et al 2010 <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0009672>,
